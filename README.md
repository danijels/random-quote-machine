# Random quote machine

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Built based off the [example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/qRZeGZ) and [requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) by freeCodeCamp

See live at [Random Quote Machine](https://danijels.github.io/random-quote-machine)

A simple straight forward mini-app.
- The user gets a random quote on the first load
- A random new quote is generated with each click on the 'New Quote' button
- The color scheme changes randomly with each new quote
- Each quote can be Tweeted from the app
